					<h4 style="padding-bottom: 1%;">
					Course Overview
					</h4>
					<p>
					Software systems around us are getting more and more complex by the day
					with multi-processor systems, microservices, and distributed programming.
					At the center of all this complexity lies concurrency, i.e., processes
					can execute in arbitrary orders and failures (e.g., network faults, node crashes, etc.)
					are pervasive.
					Building software systems is no longer straightforward (probably never was)
					and the issues introduced by concurrency cannot be ignored.
					This course will study the foundations of where these challenges arise from
					and will equip students with tools to handle these challenges.
					</p>

					<p>
					The ultimate goal is for students to build robust concurrent software systems
					using state-of-the-art PL tools and techniques.
					</p>

					Course Evaluation
					</h4>
					
					<p>
						The course grade will be calculated using homework assignments, a mid-term exam, and a final exam.
					</p>

					<h5 style="padding-bottom: 1%;">
						Homework (60%)
					</h5>

					<p>
						There will be bi-weekly homework assignments due every other Wednesday at 11:59pm.
						Homeworks can sometimes be challenging, so it is best to start early to give
						yourself enough time to think attempt the problems and make best use of office hours.
						Late homework can only be accepted in extraordinary circumstances and require approval from instructor.
					</p>

					<p>
						You are encouraged to collaborate with other students on solving the homework problems.
						But you must write your solutions independently in your own words (or code).
					</p>

					<p>
						I would strongly encourage students to typeset homework solutions using LaTeX which is the most popular document
						preparation system used in computer science publications. But students can use different software such as MS Word
						or handwrite solutions.

						For your convenience, I will provide the LaTeX source for each assignment with instructions on how to typeset
						the solutions.
					</p>

					<h5 style="padding-bottom: 1%;">
						Mid-Term (20%) and Final (20%) Exams
					</h5>

					<p>
						Exams will be held in-person and you may bring handwritten (or printed) notes to the exam. However, using other
						means such as internet, ChatGPT, phones, laptops, etc. is strictly prohibited.
					</p>

					Course FAQs
					</h4>
					
					<p>
						<i><b>Programming Language: Could you clarify which programming language(s) will be used in the course?</b></i>
					</p>
						
					<p>
					There is no fixed programming language for this course. The intent of the course is to study
					the foundations of a programming language in terms of the abstractions it provides (functions, variables,
					loops, types, etc.). These are common to most languages.
						
					That being said, there will be some programming assignments where students would be free
					to choose their own programming language to complete them. A small note here is that some
					programming assignments will be slightly easier in languages like OCaml or Rust (easier
					to define recursive types) but that doesn't mean that the assignments cannot be implemented in
					other languages.
					</p>
						
					<p>
					<i><b>Course Content: Is there a detailed syllabus available, e.g., topics covered, assignments, and major projects.</b></i>
					</p>
					
					<p> 
					The course is new and the syllabus is a bit flexible and I would collect feedback from students
					and adjust the topics based on that. However, here are some high-level topics:
					
					<ul>
					<li>lambda calculus</li>
					<li>syntax, semantics, type system</li>
					<li>progress and preservation</li>
					<li>primitive and general recursion</li>
					<li>concurrency theory</li>
					<li>message-passing concurrency</li>
					<li>shared-memory concurrency</li>
					<li>linear types</li>
					<li>session types</li>
					</ul>
						
					There will be some written assignments and some programming assignments.
					At this point, I don't plan to introduce major projects, but as I said, that might
					change if many students are interested in doing a project.
					</p>
						 
					<p>
					<i><b>Teaching Style: Could you briefly describe your teaching style and whether the course emphasizes theory, practical implementation, or a combination of both?</b></i>
					</p>

					<p>
					The course will certainly be emphasizing theory but implementation will also be a major component.
					For each topic covered, we will first study the theory behind it and then implement them in your
					language of choice.
					</p>

					<p>
					<i><b>Coursework: What types of programming assignments can students expect? Are they related to concurrency problems or parallel program development?</b></i>
					</p>

					<p>
						No, the programming assignments will be more about concurrency than parallelism.
						This course will be highlighting the challenges that concurrency introduces instead
						of the benefits that parallel programming provides. The latter is an important point
						and will be covered in a lecture but not be the central focus.
					</p>

					<p>
					<i><b>Readings: Are there any recommended readings or materials that can provide deeper insights into this?</b></i>
					</p>

					<p>
						As far as reading material goes, I am working on lecture notes that will be the
						most relevant. As I introduce various topics, I will post some optional reading
						material but the lecture notes will be the most relevant.
					</p>
